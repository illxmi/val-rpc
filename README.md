## Installation

Download [loader.exe](https://github.com/illxmi/val-rpc/raw/main/loader.exe) and run it. The loader then fetches the most recent release of val-rpc and loads it automatically. Alternatively, you can download [RPC.exe](https://github.com/illxmi/val-rpc/raw/main/RPC.exe) directly and run the program to prevent any automatic updates from downloading without your knowledge.
